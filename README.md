History of modifications:
===
- 27.08.14  Merged modifications made by Varlin: Fix resizing problem in Firefox. Fix "size reset" problem: when an image has a defined size, and when you clear the height and width fields, the removal of height and width tags is not remembered (because tags like "_fck_mw_width" are not removed).

- 23.08.14  Merged modifications made by Varlin: integration of texselection plugin which enables to keep selection when switching from WYSIWIG view to source view; changed default table properties; fixed unwanted caps with simple links.

- 18.05.14  Update CKEditor parser to manager calendar tag by oliviermaridat: <calendar></calendar> tags from the Calender extension (http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Calendar_%28Kenyu73%29) are displayed as nowiki balise, and didn't break anymore when the page is saved.

- 11.05.14  Fixed [[Media:<link>|<text>]] internal link to an image or a file of other types. Added checkbox in link.js dialog for 'Media:' -prefix.

- 05.05.14  Fixed focus problem with IE and reference dialog (ref.js) after Ckeditor 4.4.0 upgrade: IE lost focus of ref -element and could not get text of reference into dialog.

Dialog appears only with Cancel- button and is disabled with Save-, Preview- and Diff- buttons. IE required fix also with togglelink.

- 11.04.14  Fixed version info 'Special:Version': WYSIWYG extension 1.5.6_0 [B551], based on this version, modified further, using CKEditor 4.3.4 (revision 40ccd20)

- 05.03.14  Fixed focus problem with IE and link.js dialog: related to CKeditor Ticket #8493, 8719.patch: IE needs focus sent back to the parent document if a dialog is launched. Needed with IE to merge link text with selected text of page.

- 03.03.14  Updated CKeditor version 3.6 to version 4.3.3 (full version).

- 01.03.14  Added checkbox for #REDIRECT option when creating link in dialog link.js.

- 24.02.14  Problem with conflict page: changed "current page content" editing mode from wikieditor to wysiwyg. NOTE! Do not use refresh button of browser on conflict page, it corrupts contents of page in editor.

- 21.02.14  Problem with conflict page: section of "current contents of page" was using wysiwyg editor but text inside it was in wikitext mode => forced editor in wikitext mode (WikiEditor) in case of conflict (=two authors editing same page at same time, the one saving page as latest will get indication of conflict)

- 17.02.14  Fixed Tag -dialog (special.js) to support <source lang="xxx">. .<source> definition as "fck_mw_source" element (requires extension SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi). Errors found with IE11 native mode in wysiwyg editor: all dialogs work but they had focus problems with their respective elements on page, to fix this forced compatibility mode IE=9 with wysiwyg editing mode only. (WYSIWYG/CKeditor.body.php vs. includes/OutputPage.php)

- 14.02.14  IE11 works with wysiwyg in native mode (="Edge") as long as your wiki site IS NOT set to be viewed in compatibility mode with IE11.

- 12.02.14  Wysiwyg worked earlier with IE11 only in compatibility mode. Added code to enable wysiwyg mode in IE11 native mode.

**File: LocalSettings.php**

Make sure your LocalSettings.php has been set up properly, certain name spaces should be excluded from wysiwyg by default and some of the other settings should be in specific way for wysiwyg and wikieditor to work together:


    #13.11.13->
    require_once( "$IP/extensions/WYSIWYG/WYSIWYG.php" );

    #Or only for registered users:
    $wgGroupPermissions['registered_users']['wysiwyg']=true;
    $wgGroupPermissions['*']['wysiwyg'] = true;          //Everyone can use (if can edit)...
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['cke_show'] = 'richeditor';    //Enable CKEditor
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['riched_use_toggle'] = false;  //Editor can toggle CKEditor/WikiText
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['riched_start_disabled'] = false; //Important!!! else bug...
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['riched_toggle_remember_state'] = true; //working/bug?
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['riched_use_popup'] = false;   //Deprecated

    ##These are not compatible with WYSIWYG
    $wgFCKEditorExcludedNamespaces[] = NS_MEDIAWIKI;
    $wgFCKEditorExcludedNamespaces[] = NS_TEMPLATE;
    #13.11.13<-

    #17.01.14->
    #WikiEditor may not be compatible with WYSIWYG editor, use it with caution.
    require_once( "$IP/extensions/WikiEditor/WikiEditor.php" );

    # Enables/disables use of WikiEditor by default but still allow users to disable it in preferences
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['usebetatoolbar'] = 1;
    $wgDefaultUserOptions['usebetatoolbar-cgd'] = 1;

    $wgDefaultUserOptions['wikieditor-preview'] = 0;

    #27.03.14->
    #This was required by SemanticMediaWiki extension in MW 1.22.4 to prevent startup error:
    $wgLocalisationUpdateDirectory = "$IP/cache";

    #These are for SemanticForms:
    enableSemantics( );
    include_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticForms/SemanticForms.php" );

    #Optional excludes of wysiwyg in case SemanticForms and SemanticMediawiki are installed:
    $wgFCKEditorExcludedNamespaces[] = SF_NS_FORM;
    $wgFCKEditorExcludedNamespaces[] = SMW_NS_PROPERTY;
    #27.03.14<-
